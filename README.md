# Philips Hue UWP App

Often times when I'm on my desktop and the blinding light of the screen in a darkroom is huring my eyes ðŸ‘€. My phone that's able to control the philips hue light is on the opposite of my room. The simple answer would be to pick it up my phone to control my lights or just use the light switch. Nope, that would be too easy let me develop a UWP app that would allow me do this from the comfort of my Herman Miller throne ðŸ’º
